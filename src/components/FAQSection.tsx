    question: 'Who is this for?',
    answer:
      'Technical founders (pre-seed to Series A) who need rigorous financial analysis but don\'t have a CFO yet. You\'re technical, you can build, but the business/financial side feels like a different language. That\'s where we come in.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What makes you different from a fractional CFO or consultant?',
    answer:
      "We're founders who've been in your seat and analysts who've evaluated deals. We combine empathy with rigor: we understand the emotional weight of these decisions because we've made them ourselves, but we interrogate the numbers with investor-grade scrutiny. Plus, we move at startup speedâ€”48 hour turnarounds, not 3-week engagements.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does it cost?',
    answer:
      'Project-based pricing starting at $2,500 for initial strategic analysis. Think of it as insurance against expensive mistakes: one bad hire decision or poorly-timed pivot can cost 10x that amount. Let\'s talk about your specific needs and we\'ll build a custom scope.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I just need a quick gut-check, not a full engagement?',
    answer:
      'Book a discovery call. First 30 minutes are free. We\'ll give you our honest take on whether you need deep analysis or just tactical advice. Sometimes a focused conversation is all you need.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you take equity?',
    answer:
      'We prefer cash engagements to maintain objectivity, but we\'re open to hybrid arrangements (cash + equity) for the right partnerships. If we\'re aligned on vision and you\'re capital-constrained, let\'s talk.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What industries do you work with?',
    answer:
      'Primarily B2B SaaS and technical products, but our frameworks apply across industries. If you\'re a technical founder building something innovative and wrestling with strategic/financial decisions, we can probably help.',
